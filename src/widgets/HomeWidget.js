// Placeholder for home screen widget implementation.
// Creating an Android home screen widget in React Native requires a native
// module. Packages such as `react-native-android-widget` can be used. The
// widget would show upcoming tasks and allow checking them off.
// iOS widgets require a separate Swift/SwiftUI extension.
