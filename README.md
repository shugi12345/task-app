# Task App

This repository contains a simple cross-platform mobile app built with Expo
(React Native). The application allows you to track tasks with estimated time
to complete, urgency level, due dates and a simple TODO list.

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/) (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

## Running the app
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Use the Expo Go app on Android/iOS or an emulator to run the project.

## Testing
This project does not yet contain automated tests. Running `npm test` will
execute `jest` (currently no tests).
